        <h2>Hirat Citadel History</h2>
				<p>The Citadel of Herat (Persian: ارگ هرات‎, Pashto سکندرۍ کلا),
        also known as the Citadel of Alexander, and locally known as Qala
        Iktyaruddin (Persian: قلعه اختیارالدین‎), is located in the center
        of Herat in Afghanistan. It dates back to 330 BC, when <a href="file:///C:/Users/Obaid/Desktop/alexander1.html/alexander.html"><u>Alexander
        the Great</a></u> and his army arrived to what is now Afghanistan after
        the <a href="#"><u>Battle of Gaugamela.</u></a> Many empifileres have used it as a headquarters
        in the last 2,000 years, and was destroyed and rebuilt many times over the
        centuries.This historic citadel was saved from demolition in the 1950s,
        and was excavated and restored by UNESCO between 1976 and 1979.[1] From
        decades of wars and neglect, the citadel began to crumble but in recent years
        several international organizations decided to completely rebuild it. The National
        Museum of Herat is also housed inside the citadel, while the Afghan Ministry of
        Information and Culture is the caretaker of the whole premises.[2]</p>

        <p>Herat, in the fertile valley of Hari River (Hari Rud), was settled as early
        as the sixth century BC. A mound located to the north of the Old City, known as
        Kuhandazh may have been the site of the fort that Alexander the Great built in
        330 BC following his conquest of the Achaemenid city known as Artacoana or Aria.
        After the depart of Alexander, Herat was ruled by the Seleucids, Parthians, Kushans,
        Sasanians, Hephthalites, Umayyads, Tahirids, Saffarids, Samanids, Seljuk, Ghaznavids,
        and Ghurids. An 1879 painting of Herat, the citadel is visible.Located half a
       kilometer to the south of Kuhandaz and aligned with the cardinal axes, the walled city
       described by early Arab geographers had four gates leading into crossing commercial
       avenues and a square citadel (qal'a) adjoining the northern city wall. This citadel,
       which has been suggested as another possible site for Alexander's fort, is known today
       as the famous Citadel of Herat.[3] Herat thrived with the Silk Road trade from the
       Levant to India and China, and became an important city of the Ghurid dynasty in 1175.
       The city was destroyed entirely in 1221 by the Mongol army and rebuilt by the Kartid
       governors who established their rule based in Herat by the mid-thirteenth century.[4]
       Kartid Amir Fakhr al-Din (reg. 1295-1308) in 1299/1300 reinforced the citadel's towers,
       walls, ramparts and moat, and added a walled maidan to its west to serve as an open-air
       mosque (idgah). His successor Ghiyath al-Din (reg. 1308-1329) built two palaces inside
       the citadel to the east. The name Ikhtiyar al-Din, which refers to both the eastern and
       western enclosures, is thought to be the name or epithet of a Kartid amir or military
       commander. Destroyed a second time by Timur's army (1380), the citadel was rebuilt
       after Shah Rukh (reg. 1405-1444) moved his capital to Herat and began a building
       campaign. He reinforced the citadel in stone and fired brick and covered its exterior
        with glazed tiles.The citadel was used as a royal residence, treasury, prison and arsenal
        under the Hotaki dynasty/Durrani Empire in the 18th century. It suffered some damage
       during the Anglo-Afghan War in the 19th century. A modern citadel (Arg-e Herat) was
       built immediately to its north in the mid-19th century to take over its defensive
       function.The citadel was saved from demolition in the 1950s,and was excavated and
       restored by UNESCO between 1976 and 1979.It suffered more damages during the last
       decades of wars and neglect.</p>

         <h2>Recent Restoration</h2>
          <p>The citadel of Herat was completely renovated between 2006 and
            2011. It consists of two walled enclosures. The latest restoration
            involved hundreds of Afghan craftsmen and funds from the Aga Khan
            Trust for Culture and about $2.4 million from the U.S. and German
            governments.The older compound to the east, found filled with debris,
            was partially excavated to reveal two courtyard structures. It has a
            roughly rectangular plan measuring about eighteen by forty-two meters,
            and it is protected with thirteen semi-circular towers, including two
            flanking a west-facing gate. It is also known as the Upper Citadel,
            based on its elevated site, and is built of fired bricks.
            The Kartid addition to the west, known as the Lower Citadel, has
            lower walls of baked brick and includes Timurid period military structures.
            Its polygonal plan measures about twenty-five by sixty meters with nine circular
            towers, of which six survive along the south and west walls. The tall Malik Tower
             on its western wall is thought to be named after a Kartid malik and retains
             segments of its Timurid glazed tile decoration, including parts of a Kufic
             inscriptive band.An Ethnographic Museum, a Military Museum, Handicraft Workshops
             and an Archaeological Museum were set up inside the Lower Citadel after the 1970s
             restoration, while the Upper Citadel was opened to visitors as an Open Air
             Archaeological Museum, with a northern section reconstructed as a traditional residence.
             About 1,100 items from the Herat region are stored inside the museum at the citadel,
             of which 250 are on display currently.[2]At a ceremony in October 2011, U.S. Ambassador Ryan
            Crocker stated that: "Until 35 years ago, tourists from around the world came here to
            experience heritage, history and incomparable national landscapes... We look forward to
            the day when Afghans and visitors from around the world will once again come here to learn
            about Afghanistan's rich history and enjoy the great hospitality and beauty that this land
             and its people have to offer." Also present on the occasion was Afghan-expert Nancy Dupree
             and this is what she had to say: "I've been here many times, but it was crumbling... This
             is impressive.... I think the most exciting thing is to see something finally accomplished.
             I have seen so many half-finished things."[2]</p>
